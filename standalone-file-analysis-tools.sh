# Standalone File Analysis Tools
# Extracted from GWOMBAT for general filesystem analysis
# These tools are designed for local file system analysis and organization

# NOTE: These tools were originally part of GWOMBAT but moved here because they focus on
# local filesystem analysis rather than Google Drive/Shared Drive management.

# REMAINING FILE DISCOVERY TASKS TO IMPLEMENT (if needed in future):
# - File Age Analysis (temporal analysis of file creation/modification patterns)
# - File Size Patterns (storage usage patterns and optimization opportunities)  
# - File Dependency Mapping (analyze file relationships and dependencies)
# - Orphaned File Detection (find files no longer linked to applications)
# - Temporary File Cleanup (identify and clean cache/temp files)
# - Hidden File Discovery (locate hidden files and system files)
# - File Inventory Generator (comprehensive file cataloging system)
# - Custom Discovery Rules (user-defined file analysis patterns)
