# Temporary Hold Master Script
#
# A comprehensive script that consolidates all temporary hold operations for suspended user accounts into a single interactive tool with preview functionality.
#
# ## Overview
#
# This script automates the process of moving user accounts from "pending deletion" status to "temporary hold" status. It performs four main operations:
#
# 1. **Restore Last Name** - Removes "(PENDING DELETION - CONTACT OIT)" from user's last name
# 2. **Fix Filenames** - Renames files with pending deletion markers
# 3. **Rename All Files** - Adds "(Suspended Account - Temporary Hold)" to all user files
# 4. **Update User Last Name** - Adds suspension marker to user's last name
#
# ## Features
#
# - **Interactive Menu System** - Choose between single user or batch processing
# - **Preview Mode** - Shows detailed summary of all actions before execution
# - **User Confirmation** - Requires approval before making any changes
# - **Progress Tracking** - Shows progress when processing multiple users
# - **Error Handling** - Validates inputs and checks for required directories
# - **Comprehensive Logging** - Records all operations and changes
# - **Color-coded Output** - Easy-to-read status messages
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# - GAM (Google Apps Manager) installed at `/usr/local/bin/gam`
# - Access to the following directories:
#   - `/opt/your-path/mjb9/suspended` (script path)
#   - `/opt/your-path/mjb9/listshared` (shared files path)
# - Required script dependencies:
#   - `list-users-files.sh` in the listshared directory
#
# ## Installation
#
# 1. Ensure the script is executable:
#    ```bash
#    chmod +x master-temphold.sh
#    ```
#
# 2. Verify GAM is installed and accessible:
#    ```bash
#    /usr/local/bin/gam version
#    ```
#
# 3. Check that required directories exist and are accessible
#
# ## Usage
#
# ### Interactive Mode
#
# Run the script without arguments to enter interactive mode:
#
# ```bash
# ./master-temphold.sh
# ```
#
# ### Menu Options
#
# 1. **Process user by username/email**
#    - Enter a single username or email address
#    - View summary of actions
#    - Confirm before execution
#
# 2. **Load users from file**
#    - Specify path to file containing usernames (one per line)
#    - Preview sample users from file
#    - Batch process all users
#
# 3. **Exit**
#    - Safely exit the script
#
# ### File Format for Batch Processing
#
# Create a text file with one username/email per line:
#
# ```
# user1@domain.com
# user2@domain.com
# user3@domain.com
# ```
#
# - Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored
# - Each user will go through the complete 4-step process
#
# ## Process Details
#
# ### Step 1: Restore Last Name
# - Checks if user's last name contains "(PENDING DELETION - CONTACT OIT)"
# - If found, removes the suffix and restores original last name
# - If not found, skips this step
#
# ### Step 2: Fix Filenames
# - Searches for files with "(PENDING DELETION - CONTACT OIT)" in filename
# - Renames them to include "(Suspended Account - Temporary Hold)"
# - Logs all changes to `tmp/{username}-fixed.txt`
#
# ### Step 3: Rename All Files
# - Generates comprehensive file list using `list-users-files.sh`
# - Adds "(Suspended Account - Temporary Hold)" suffix to all file names
# - Skips files that already have the suffix
#
# ### Step 4: Update User Last Name
# - Adds "(Suspended Account - Temporary Hold)" to user's last name
# - Skips if suffix already present
#
# ## Output and Logging
#
# ### Log Files Created:
# - `temphold-done.log` - Users successfully processed
# - `file-rename-done.txt` - Timestamp log of file rename operations
# - `tmp/{username}-fixed.txt` - Detailed log of specific file changes
#
# ### Temporary Files:
# - `tmp/gam_output_{username}.txt` - GAM query results
# - CSV files in `${LISTSHARED_PATH}/csv-files/` directory
#
# ## Error Handling
#
# The script includes comprehensive error checking:
#
# - Validates user input
# - Checks file existence for batch processing
# - Verifies required directories exist
# - Handles GAM command failures gracefully
# - Provides clear error messages
#
# ## Color Coding
#
# - ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Headers and informational messages
# - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Success messages and step indicators
# - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Warnings and progress indicators
# - ðŸ”´ **Red**: Error messages
#
# ## Safety Features
#
# - **Preview Mode**: Shows exactly what will happen before execution
# - **User Confirmation**: Requires explicit approval before making changes
# - **Non-destructive**: Only adds suffixes, doesn't delete data
# - **Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations
# - **Validation**: Checks for existing suffixes to prevent duplicates
#
# ## Troubleshooting
#
# ### Common Issues:
#
# 1. **GAM not found**
#    - Verify GAM is installed at `/usr/local/bin/gam`
#    - Check PATH environment variable
#
# 2. **Permission denied**
#    - Ensure script has execute permissions
#    - Check directory access permissions
#
# 3. **Required directories missing**
#    - Verify `/opt/your-path/mjb9/suspended` exists
#    - Verify `/opt/your-path/mjb9/listshared` exists
#
# 4. **list-users-files.sh not found**
#    - Ensure the script exists in the listshared directory
#    - Check execute permissions on the script
#
# ### Debug Mode:
#
# To enable verbose output, you can modify the script to add `set -x` at the top for debugging.
#
