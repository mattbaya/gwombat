## Current Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ PASSED (7/7 completed categories)
1. **Database Schema**: All tables, indexes, and views created correctly
2. **Script Syntax**: All shell scripts pass syntax validation
3. **Database Content**: 18 accounts properly imported with correct staging
4. **Database Functions**: Load and integrate successfully (with workarounds for path issues)
5. **Environment Setup**: Configuration files present and accessible
6. **Interactive Menu System**: Main menu displays correctly, setup wizard functional
7. **Database Operations**: Account list creation works, test list successfully created

### ‚úÖ FIXED (8 critical issues resolved)
1. **‚úÖ Deployment Script Created**: deploy.sh script created with full git-based deployment functionality
2. **‚úÖ Configuration File Organization**: local-config/.env file properly organized with template support
3. **‚úÖ Timeout Handling Added**: GAM and rclone checks now have timeout handling to prevent hangs
4. **‚úÖ GAM Path Fixed**: Dependency check now uses configured GAM path from environment
5. **‚úÖ Database Schema Path Fixed**: Added automatic SCRIPTPATH detection in database_functions.sh
6. **‚úÖ log_info Function Added**: Added fallback log_info function to database_functions.sh
7. **‚úÖ Setup Process Working**: Setup wizard detected and can be skipped for direct operation
8. **‚úÖ GAM Integration Ready**: GAM path properly configured with timeout handling for verification

### ‚è≥ PENDING (Major test categories remaining)
1. **GAM Integration**: Cannot test due to path configuration issues
2. **Account Operations**: Limited testing due to GAM dependency issues
3. **Error Handling**: Test failure scenarios and recovery
4. **Performance**: Test with larger datasets and concurrent operations

## Next Testing Steps

### High Priority
1. **Test Interactive Menu System**
   - Start gwombat.sh and navigate through menus
   - Test database maintenance options
   - Verify account list management

2. **Test Database Operations**
   - Create new account lists
   - Add accounts to lists
   - Test verification workflows

3. **Locate/Create Deployment Script**
   - Check git history for deploy.sh
   - Recreate based on DEPLOYMENT.md if missing

### Medium Priority
4. **Test GAM Integration** (requires GAM setup)
5. **Test Account Scanning** (requires Google Workspace access)
6. **Performance Testing** with larger datasets

### Low Priority
7. **Security audit** of all scripts
8. **Documentation verification** against actual functionality

## Testing Environment Details
- **Location**: /Users/mjb9/scripts/gwombat
- **Database**: gwombat.db (98KB with 18 accounts)
- **Last Updated**: August 16, 2025
- **Git Status**: Clean working directory on main branch

## Recovery Instructions
If testing crashes or is interrupted:
1. Navigate to /Users/mjb9/scripts/gwombat
2. Check this file for current progress
3. Continue from the "Next Testing Steps" section
4. Update test results as you progress
5. Mark completed items with ‚úÖ and timestamp

## Notes
- All testing assumes defensive security context only
- No malicious code creation or testing
- Focus on legitimate administrative and security functions
- Maintain audit trail of all test operations
