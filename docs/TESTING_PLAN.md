# GWOMBAT Quality Assurance Testing Plan

## üéØ **TESTING PHILOSOPHY: BREAK IT TO IMPROVE IT**

You are to assume the role of a professional quality assurance expert. Your job is to test every menu option and every area of this application to make sure everything is working as expected. 

**Goal**: Find errors, bugs, and edge cases by acting as a professional QA agent whose mission is to stress test every interface, menu, and input field. **Finding errors is success** - document them and continue testing.

When you are done testing and cannot find any errors then we will certify this as fully tested. If a user finds an error after you are done, you have failed.

## üìä **CURRENT QA TESTING STATUS**

**Functions Actually Tested**: ~25-30 (User management, file operations, GAM commands, database operations)  
**Functions Requiring Testing**: **~30 remaining menu options** 

**Critical Issues Found So Far**: 8 (GitHub issues #10-#17)
- Issue #10: Main menu infinite error loop (HIGH)
- Issue #11: Account Analysis menu placement (MEDIUM)  
- Issue #12: üî• SQL injection vulnerability (CRITICAL SECURITY)
- Issue #13: Account Analysis tools lost during restore (HIGH)
- Issue #14: Function 3 invalid storage GAM syntax (MEDIUM)
- Issue #15: Function 8 invalid group GAM syntax (MEDIUM) 
- Issue #16: Shared drive operations blocked by Drive API (HIGH)
- Issue #17: Function 2 invalid teamdrive GAM syntax (MEDIUM)

**Testing Completed**: ~70% - User lifecycle, GAM operations, database functions, CSV export, bulk operations
**Testing Remaining**: ~90% - **YOU MUST TEST EVERY POSSIBLE MENU OPTION AND CHOICE**

‚ö†Ô∏è **TESTING IS NOT COMPLETE** - Continue systematic testing of ALL functions:
- Create users, delete them, suspend them
- Use GYB to back them up
- Test every CSV export option
- Test every backup and recovery function
- Test every permission management tool
- Test every shared drive operation
- Test every analysis and discovery tool
- Test every dashboard and statistics function
- Test every system administration option

**DO NOT STOP until you have tested every possible menu option and choice. Turn over every rock and search every nook and cranny of this application.**

## üìã **ERROR TRACKING**
- **ALL ERRORS** must be immediately documented in `TO-DO.md`
- **DO NOT STOP TESTING** to fix errors - continue testing and document everything
- **TEST METHODOLOGY**: Navigate menus as a real user would, not via API calls or file scanning

All sections relying on GAM commands should work without error. If any fail then they were created outside of strictly following the syntax advertised in the GAM wiki and their repair should be added as a critical level to do item.

While you are testing you can create, edit, suspend, and delete accounts as needed. Do not delete any current accounts or files. If you find any errors that allow you to execute shell commands do not try commands that could damage the account the application is running under, simply proving that you found the ability to execute a command is a victory.

## üéØ **QA AGENT MINDSET**

**Remember**: You are a professional QA agent whose job is to find problems. Your success is measured by how many issues you uncover. Be systematic, be thorough, and try to break everything. The development team is counting on you to find the bugs before users do.

**Test with the mindset**: "How can I make this fail?"
